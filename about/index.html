  <h1 class="page-heading">About Matt...</h1>

  <p>
    Hello! I am a London-based developer currently keeping myself busy working for Net-A-Porter.com. I am interested in all things web, including HTML and CSS, Javascript both in the browser and on the server, application architecture, and infrastructure.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am passionate about web performance, from building fast, highly-available servers, to ensuring websites render and perform as quickly and as smoothly as possible in the browser.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am a huge believer in TDD, and anyone I have worked with will confirm I spend far too much time talking about the benefits of testing. From unit, functional, integration, contract, load, soak, and performance testing, writing code to test your software is by far the most reliable and efficient way to ensure that the software you write is of the highest quiality.

  <p>
    This blog will contain posts on a variety of subjects, with one thing in common: they will interest me in someway. Oh, and it will all relate to software development.
  </p>

  <p>
    Enjoy!
